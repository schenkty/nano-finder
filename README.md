# nano-finder

This tool allows you to search a seed for your nano address. 

Please only use this tool while you are offline, I am not responsible for any leaked seeds or lost funds.

Javascript functions in `js` folder are not mine. I do not recall where I found them but the proper credit should go to those individuals only.

2. Disable internet connection

4. Enter the account you would like to find

Disclaimer - Seed searching is not optimized and may hang up your computer while it is searching
